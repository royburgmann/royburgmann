- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @royburgmann and currently in my final semester of Bachelor of ICT (Information Communication Technology)
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently looking for a job in the IT space. All fields of IT interest me
- ðŸ‘€ My Github projects utilise a variety of technologies, including XCode, Java, Android Studio, Selenium and much more. Majority of my projects display the basics of these technologies thus far, however I'm always diving deeping to get a better understanding. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and Selenium. A current project I am developing is a Transport Management Web Application. I'm utilising selenium to accelerate testing on the web application.
